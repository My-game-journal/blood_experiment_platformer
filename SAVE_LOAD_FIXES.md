# Save/Load System Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Main Menu Load Function (`main_menu.gd`)**
- **Problem**: Didn't properly update the health bar when loading a saved game
- **Fix**: Added health bar synchronization after loading player health
- **Added**: Better error handling with print statements

### 2. **Paused Menu Save Function (`paused_menu.gd`)**
- **Problem**: Was saving health bar value instead of actual player health
- **Fix**: Now saves `player.health` directly
- **Added**: Success confirmation message

### 3. **Paused Menu Load Function (`paused_menu.gd`)**
- **Problem**: Wasn't updating player health variable, only health bar
- **Fix**: Now updates both `player.health` and health bar for consistency
- **Added**: Better error handling and confirmation messages

### 4. **Global Save/Load Script (`global_save_load.gd`)**
- **Added**: Comprehensive error handling and debug messages
- **Added**: Validation for save file format
- **Added**: Clear success/failure feedback

## How It Works Now:

### Saving:
1. Gets player position and actual health value
2. Saves to `user://saved_game.txt` in format: `x,y,health`
3. Provides confirmation message

### Loading:
1. Reads save file and validates format
2. Updates player position and health
3. Synchronizes health bar with loaded health value
4. Provides feedback on success/failure

## Testing:
- All scripts compile without errors
- Save/load functions now properly handle both player health and health bar synchronization
- Added debug output for easier troubleshooting
